        <h1>The World's <strong>Best</strong> B.L.T.</h1>

        <p>The success of a BLT hangs in its balance of salt, acid, 
            lusciousness and crunch. This version is perfect, with a 
            generous swipe of mayonnaise on each slice of toast, 
            followed by a drizzle of olive oil, tomatoes marinated in 
            red wine vinegar and salt, butter lettuce leaves and 
            thick-cut bacon. Squash this closed and eat while the 
            bacon is still warm. BLTs are often associated with 
            summer, but the vinegar here coaxes flavor and brings 
            brightness to hothouse tomatoes, turning it into a 
            sandwich for all seasons.</p>
