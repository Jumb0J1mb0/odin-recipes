        <p> </p>
        <p> Only 4 ingredients are needed to make this amazingly 
        rustic french baguette! The ingredients for the recipe can 
        be found below: </p>
        <ul> 
            <li>1 cup water and 1/2 cup luke warm water, separated</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Prep/Fold the Dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the warm water into a large bowl. Sprinkle 
                yeast on top. Place the bowl in a warm place for 
                about 10-15 minutes. Be patient! If yeast is 
                activated, you will see foam on top of the mixture, 
                and even a few small bubbles. Also, if you take 
                sniff, it will smell very much like yeast.</li>
            <li>Gently stir in flour and salt.  Add the other cup of 
                water and mix until just combined into a sticky, 
                shaggy dough. Cover with a towel and let rest for 
                45 minutes.</li>
            <li>This step includes 4 repetitions of "folding" and 
                "resting" for a total of 3 hours resting time: 
                Instead of dusting your hands with flour, wet your 
                hands with a little water and "fold" the dough: 
                Leaving the dough in the bowl, stretch one side of 
                the dough up and then over the top of the dough. 
                Turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat until you've 
                done each side. Flip the dough over, cover, and let 
                rest another 45 minutes. Repeat this folding and 
                resting process 3 more times.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Shape the Dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                After the fourth resting period is done, take the 
                dough out of the bowl and place on a lightly floured 
                surface. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. If you 
                have a scale, use it to weight each piece to make 
                sure each is the same amount.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shape each piece into a rectangle and gently stretch 
                out the ends. Cover with an oiled piece of plastic 
                wrap and let rest for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                After resting, sprinkle each rectangle with a little 
                bit of flour, a very light dusting so your hands 
                don't stick. Fold each rectangle in half lengthwise 
                and flip over seam side down. Gently roll each piece 
                into a roughly 15 inch long log about 1.5 inches in 
                diameter. Gently stretch out the ends again and using 
                your fingertips press them together into a point, 
                forming the baguette shape.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gently move the baguettes onto a bakers couche or 
                make your own using a lightly floured towel (I used 
                a large tea towel): using the towel, create a ridge 
                between each baguette (think taco stand). This will 
                make sure the baguettes maintain their shape while 
                you let them rest for the final time. Cover with an 
                oiled piece of plastic wrap and let rest for 30 
                minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Bake the Baguette</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                While the baguettes are resting, turn your oven on 
                to preheat to 450 F. During the last 10 minutes of 
                rest time, place a pan on the bottom rack of the oven 
                and fill with boiling water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper. VERY 
                carefully move each baguette on to the tray. Spray 
                each baguette with a little water. Dust the tops 
                lightly with flour. Score each one with 4 to 5 
                overlapping lines about 1/2 inch deep.
            </li>
            <li>
                Being careful of the steam, open the oven and place 
                the tray with the baguettes on the center rack. Spray 
                 a little more water into the oven to make sure there 
                 is enough steam.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 16-18 minutes, rotating halfway through, 
                until baguettes are a deep golden brown and sound 
                hollow when the bottom is tapped. Take care not to 
                overcook or you'll use the soft center!
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the baguettes to a wire rack to cool. 
                Slice and enjoy!
            </li>
